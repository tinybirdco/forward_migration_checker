# Tinybird Classic to Forward Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

The migration assessment has identified several key issues that need to be addressed before migrating to Tinybird Forward.  The most critical issues are the presence of Sinks, potential compatibility issues with DynamoDB connections, and the need to verify the compatibility of include files. Additionally, the absence of version tags could complicate the migration process, and it's crucial to remember that BI connector is not available in Tinybird Forward.

## Check Results

### 1. Version Tags Check
**Status**: WARNING
- **Issues**: No version tag files found. Version management is recommended for migration tracking.
- **Files Checked**: 0

### 2. Sinks Check
**Status**: FIXED
- **Issues**: Sink found in tinybird/pipes/s3_sink_example.pipe: Sinks are not supported in Tinybird Forward
- **Files Checked**: 2
- **üîß Auto-Fixes Applied**: 1 issues were automatically fixed
  - Commented out sink declarations in tinybird/pipes/s3_sink_example.pipe

### 3. Shared Datasources Check
**Status**: PASS
- **Issues**: None
- **Files Checked**: 2

### 4. DynamoDB Connections Check
**Status**: WARNING
- **Issues**: DynamoDB connection found in tinybird/datasources/sample_data.datasource: DynamoDB imports may have limitations in Forward
- **Files Checked**: 2

### 5. Endpoint Types Check
**Status**: PASS
- **Issues**: None
- **Files Checked**: 1

### 6. Include Files Check
**Status**: FIXED
- **Issues**: Include statement found in tinybird/pipes/example_with_include.pipe: Verify include file compatibility; Found 1 include files: Review for Forward compatibility
- **Files Checked**: 6
- **üîß Auto-Fixes Applied**: 2 issues were automatically fixed
  - Commented out INCLUDE statements in tinybird/pipes/example_with_include.pipe; Moved tinybird/includes_backup/common_filters.incl to tinybird/includes_backup/common_filters.incl

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning

**BI Connector Deprecation**: Please note that the BI Connector feature is not available in Tinybird Forward. If your current setup relies on BI Connector integrations, you will need to migrate to alternative connection methods such as:
- REST API endpoints
- SQL API
- Direct integrations with supported BI tools

## Migration Plan

1.  Address version tag issues: Create and maintain version tags for your Tinybird project to track changes and facilitate migration.
2.  Remove Sinks: Delete or comment out the sink definitions in `tinybird/pipes/s3_sink_example.pipe` as sinks are not supported in Tinybird Forward. Consider alternative methods for data export or integration.
3.  Review DynamoDB Connections: Examine the DynamoDB connection in `tinybird/datasources/sample_data.datasource`.  Ensure that the connection configuration and data types are compatible with Tinybird Forward's data import capabilities.  Test thoroughly after migration.
4.  Verify Include File Compatibility: Inspect all include files (as used in `tinybird/pipes/example_with_include.pipe`) for compatibility with Tinybird Forward.  Pay close attention to any deprecated functions or syntax.  Ensure the included files are accessible during the migration process.
5.  Validate Data Sources: After migrating, validate all data sources to confirm that data is being ingested correctly and that queries return the expected results.
6.  Functional Testing: Perform thorough functional testing of all endpoints and dataflows to ensure that the migrated project behaves as expected.
7.  Monitor Performance: After migration, continuously monitor the performance of your Tinybird Forward project to identify and address any performance bottlenecks or issues.

## Auto-Fixes Summary

The following issues were automatically fixed during this migration check:


**Sinks Check**:
- Commented out sink declarations in tinybird/pipes/s3_sink_example.pipe

**Include Files Check**:
- Commented out INCLUDE statements in tinybird/pipes/example_with_include.pipe
- Moved tinybird/includes_backup/common_filters.incl to tinybird/includes_backup/common_filters.incl

**Total**: 3 issues were automatically resolved.

## Next Steps

1. Review all identified issues above
2. For any remaining issues, implement the recommended fixes
3. Test your modified configuration in a development environment
4. Contact Tinybird support if you need assistance with specific migration challenges

## Backup Files

If automatic fixes were applied, backup files were created with the `.backup` extension. You can restore the original files if needed:

```bash
# To restore a file from backup
cp file.datasource.backup file.datasource
```
