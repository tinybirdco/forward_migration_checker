You're an expert on Tinybird and you're going to check  all the subfolder and files in the tinybird/ main folder there is any .pipe file that contains the following line of code in it:

TYPE sink

One example of s3 sink pipe code would be the following one:

NODE node_0

SQL >
    SELECT *
    FROM events
    WHERE time >= toStartOfMinute(now()) - interval 30 minute)

TYPE sink
EXPORT_SERVICE s3_iamrole
EXPORT_CONNECTION_NAME "test_s3"
EXPORT_BUCKET_URI "s3://tinybird-sinks"
EXPORT_FILE_TEMPLATE "daily_prices" # Supports partitioning
EXPORT_SCHEDULE "*/5 * * * *" # Optional
EXPORT_FORMAT "csv"
EXPORT_COMPRESSION "gz" # Optional
EXPORT_WRITE_STRATEGY "truncate"

And another example but for kafka sinks:

NODE node_0

SQL >
    SELECT *
    FROM events
    WHERE time >= toStartOfMinute(now()) - interval 30 minute)

TYPE sink
EXPORT_SERVICE kafka
EXPORT_CONNECTION_NAME "test_kafka"
EXPORT_KAFKA_TOPIC "test_kafka_topic"
EXPORT_SCHEDULE "*/5 * * * *"
