You're an expert on Tinybird that is working in the migration from Classic to Forward and you're going to check all the subfolders' files in the tinybird/ main folder to look fort the VERSION tag. 

One example of resource with the VERSION tag is the following one for a data source:

VERSION 3
DESCRIPTION >
    Customer entity materialized view

SCHEMA >
    `companyId` AggregateFunction(argMax, String, DateTime64(3)),
    `createdAt` AggregateFunction(argMax, DateTime64(3), DateTime64(3)),
    `createdBy` AggregateFunction(argMax, String, DateTime64(3)),
    `createdByType` AggregateFunction(argMax, String, DateTime64(3)),
    `domainEventTimestamp` AggregateFunction(argMax, DateTime64(3), DateTime64(3)),
    `domainEventType` AggregateFunction(argMax, String, DateTime64(3)),
    `eventType` AggregateFunction(argMax, String, DateTime64(3)),
    `externalId` AggregateFunction(argMax, String, DateTime64(3)),
    `id` String,
    `markedAsSpamAt` AggregateFunction(argMax, DateTime64(3), DateTime64(3)),
    `markedAsSpamBy` AggregateFunction(argMax, String, DateTime64(3)),
    `markedAsSpamByType` AggregateFunction(argMax, String, DateTime64(3)),
    `updated_at` AggregateFunction(max, DateTime64(3)),
    `updatedBy` AggregateFunction(argMax, String, DateTime64(3)),
    `updatedByType` AggregateFunction(argMax, String, DateTime64(3)),
    `workspaceId` String,
    `deletedAt` AggregateFunction(argMax, DateTime64(3), DateTime64(3)),
    `deletedBy` AggregateFunction(argMax, String, DateTime64(3)),
    `deletedByType` AggregateFunction(argMax, String, DateTime64(3))

ENGINE "AggregatingMergeTree"
ENGINE_SORTING_KEY "workspaceId, id"


Another example but for pipes:

VERSION 4
DESCRIPTION >
	The latest state of customers as we see it in our production database,
    ommitting any fields not currently used by downstream endpoints


NODE customer_entity
DESCRIPTION >
    The latest state of threads as we see it in our production database

SQL >

    %
        SELECT
            id,
            if(
                argMaxMerge(companyId) = '<NULL_VALUE>', 
                null, 
                argMaxMerge(companyId)
            ) as companyId,
            if(
                argMaxMerge(markedAsSpamAt) = parseDateTime64BestEffort('1970-01-01'), 
                null, 
                argMaxMerge(markedAsSpamAt)
            ) as markedAsSpamAt
        FROM customer_entity_mv_1
        {% if defined(workspaceId) %}
            WHERE workspaceId = {{ workspaceId }}
        {% end %}
        GROUP BY
            id

TYPE endpoint


The solution is to remove the VERSION line code since it's not supported in Forward yet but let's ask customer before running the remove command.
