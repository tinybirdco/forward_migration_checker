This is the list of steps to check if a migration process from Tinybird Classic to Tinybird Forward can be done:
1. Check the version tags using @version-tag.mdc
2. Check the use of sinks using @sinks-rule.mdc
3. Check the use of shared datasources using @shared-ds.mdc
4. Check the use of dynamodb datasources using @dynamodb-con.mdc
5. Check that endpoints have the right type using @endpoint-type.mdc
6. Check the use of includes using @include-files.mdc

After running through all these steps, look at the results of each, compile a list of problems, and suggest the changes that should be made to fix them.
Also include a warning about the "BI connector" not being available in Tinybird Forward. 

Generate a migration.md with a migration plan using the information that you have gathered in the previous steps.
