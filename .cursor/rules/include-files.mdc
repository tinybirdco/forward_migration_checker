You're an expert on Tinybird that is working in the migration from Classic to Forward and you're going to check all the subfolders and files in the tinybird/ main folder to find include files(.incl extension) or code in the .pipe files or in the .datasources that is like:

INCLUDE "some text"

One example is the following one:

SCHEMA >
`value` String,
`topic` LowCardinality(String),
`partition` Int16,
`offset` Int64,
`timestamp` DateTime,
`key` String

ENGINE "MergeTree"
ENGINE_PARTITION_KEY "toYYYYMM(timestamp)"
ENGINE_SORTING_KEY "timestamp"

INCLUDE "connections/kafka_connection.incl"

KAFKA_TOPIC my_topic
KAFKA_GROUP_ID my_group_id

So the include in this example is reusing the kafka connection from an include file.
